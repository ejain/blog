    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog started out on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">GeoCities</a> sometime during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">dot-com bubble</a>. Somewhere along the way I moved it to a proper hosting provider (first <a href="guest-hosting.ch">guest-hosting.ch</a>, then <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/en-us">Rackspace</a>), acquired a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.name">.name</a> domain, and set up a custom <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> installation.</p>
<p>This setup was flexible, but meant I had to stay on top of security updates for WordPress (until automatic updates were introduced), remember to update the packages installed on the server (Ubuntu) once in a while, and deal with occasional comment spam. Also, page load times weren’t great (even with various caching plugins), since the site was being served from a low-end virtual server, which nevertheless cost me about $10 a month.</p>
<p>This made going back to serving simple, static files an attractive option. <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> was an obvious choice for hosting the site, since I already had several projects on GitHub. I’d also need a <em>static site generator</em> to create the web pages from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> files I exported from WordPress:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> would have been the default choice, since GitHub Pages has built-in support for Jekyll. But I wanted to be able to build the site on my own machine as well, and that turned out to be painful to set up, and very slow.</li>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> appeared to have most of the same features, and was much faster.</li>
<li><a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> seemed fast enough, and easier for me to customize than Hugo.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ended up creating a custom theme for Hexo based on <a href="https://github.com/klugjo/hexo-theme-clean-blog">this theme</a>.</p>
<p><img src="blog.png" alt="Screenshot"></p>
<p>Since switching to serving static pages, I no longer need to worry about security updates. Pages are served fast (<a href="https://uptimerobot.com/">UptimeRobot</a> reports response times of well under 100ms). I do miss having a bit more control (like being able to change the cache headers), but so far so good…</p>
<p>You can see the source code for this site <a href="https://github.com/ejain/blog/">here</a> (the source itself is in the <code>master</code> branch, and the generated pages in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch).</p>

    <title>Subaru Crosstrek</title>
    <link href="http://eric.jain.name/2016/09/17/subaru-crosstrek/"/>

    <published>2016-09-17T07:00:00.000Z</published>
    <updated>2017-03-06T02:40:36.237Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With my 2008 Honda Civic approaching 100K miles, I decided it was time to replace it. The Civic had been very reliable, and put up with a lot of abuse from driving on bumpy dirt roads without any problems–apart from one broken motor mount. But I didn’t want to push my luck. Also, the upcoming winter is forecast to have proper snow again…</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good ground clearance and suspension, so I don’t have to crawl around every pothole, and be afraid of scraping the bottom of the car.</li>
<li>Similar width and length as the old car, so I can park the car around town without causing too much damage.</li>
<li>Adaptive cruise control, so I can use cruise control even when the road isn’t empty (and feel like the new car is more sophisticated than the old car).</li>
<li>Silver color, so dirt and scratches aren’t quite as visble.</li>
<li>Decent gas mileage (at least 30mpg).</li>
<li>Cost &lt;$30K.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cars I considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honda HRV</li>
<li>Mazda CX-5</li>
<li>Subaru Crosstrek</li>
</ul>
<p>The HRV would have been an obvious choice, given my good experience with the Civic and the <a href="http://www.hondaofseattle.com/">Honda of Seattle</a> service department. Unfortunately, the HRV doesn’t have an option for adaptive cruise control (need to get the larger CRV for that), and the ground clearance isn’t great. The CX-5 and the Crosstrek have similar ground clearance, features, safety ratings etc. The CX-5 has an option for a more powerful engine, but feels more like an SUV than a compact car, so I decided to check out the Crosstrek first.</p>
<p>I test-drove a Crosstrek two weeks ago at <a href="http://www.chaplinssubaru.com/">Chaplin Subaru</a>, and loved it, but no one had the configuration I was looking for. <a href="http://www.royrobinson.com/">Roy Robinson Subaru</a> was one of 3 dealers in the region to receive a matching Crosstrek today (and one of the easiest to deal with), so that’s who got my business!</p>
<p><img src="crosstrek.jpg" alt="Crosstrek 2.0i Premium"></p>
<p>Things I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some dealers are still having a hard time with the internet. Had to restate my original request up to three times before getting an answer from some of them.</li>
<li>If you are buying a popular model, finding a dealer who has a vehicle available can be tricky.</li>
<li>Even so, every dealer (with the exception of Carter Subaru in Seattle) was willing the match prices, and sell at $1K “below invoice”, which happened to correspond to the price I got from <a href="https://www.truecar.com/">TrueCar</a>.</li>
<li>Local sales taxes differ slightly from dealer to dealer; this can add up to a few hundred $.</li>
<li>Dealers load up cars with optional features you might not need; doing a factory order could have saved me almost $1K.</li>
<li>…however, negotiating a <a href="https://www.kbb.com/used-cars/">good trade-in value</a> for the old car would have been difficult with a factory order (which takes at least 6 weeks to deliver).</li>
<li>Doing a trade-in has significant tax advantages.</li>
</ul>

    <title>Tableau &amp; Quantified Self</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tableau has a <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/contest/QS">contest</a> going on for visualizing Quantified Self data. I happen to have a fair amount of such of data from all kinds of sources on <a href="https://zenobase.com/">zenobase.com</a>, so I decided to give it a shot.</p>
<p>I was curious about Tableau’s geo features, and how well Tableau would handle slightly larger data sets. So I chose some outdoor/fitness activity data (which includes coordinates), and some hour-resolution energy expenditure data (~10K records).</p>
<p>Getting the data into Tableau was straightforward, as Zenobase exports data in <acronym>CSV</acronym> format. Tableau didn’t detect any data types (timestamps, coordinates, or even numbers), but that was easy to fix after the import had completed. Working with the larger data set was not a problem, either, even if the experience wasn’t exactly snappy.</p>
<p>You can find the result embedded below. The “dashboard” is interactive, so you can select one or more days of the week (and/or hours of the day), and the map will update to show activities that started at the corresponding time.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend I attended my first <a href="http://euroseattle.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a>. The event was very well organized; I had a great time and got to know a lot of good people.</p>
<p>Didn’t get enough votes for the idea I pitched (a dating site that matches people using data from services like Fitbit), so I ended up joining another team to build <a href="http://www.myloop.co/">an app that generates running routes that pass near popular sights</a>.</p>
<p><img src="myloop_app.png" title="Generated route starting at Louisa's Cafe" width="180" height="300"/></p>
<p>Our team consisted of 6 “non-technicals” and 3 developers (including myself). There was little friction, and I was impressed how well tasks like market research were performed. Somewhat less impressive was the amount of time spent discussing logos and background colors. Also, does the “Minimum Viable Product” really need a built-in music player? :-)</p>
<p>Despite Startup Weekend’s slogan (“No Talk, All Action”), there isn’t much incentive to put a lot of development effort into anything but building smoke and mirrors: Even though we had what appeared to be the only (somewhat) usable product, we didn’t even make it into the top 4…</p>
<p>Every Startup Weekend is probably unique, but it would be more worthwhile for developers if there was some technical mentorship, and judges also took execution into consideration, not just business plans.</p>

    <title>Lenovo Thinkpad T431s</title>
    <link href="http://eric.jain.name/2013/07/05/lenovo-thinkpad-t431s/"/>
    <id>http://eric.jain.name/2013/07/05/lenovo-thinkpad-t431s/</id>
    <published>2013-07-05T07:00:00.000Z</published>
    <updated>2017-02-28T08:18:02.991Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Got a Thinkpad T431s to replace my 3-year old T410s. Here are some random observations, after using the new laptop for a few weeks.</p>
<p><img src="T431s.jpg" alt="T431s"></p>
<p>The T431s feels much lighter than the T410s. The screen is a bit smaller (still 14”, but more elongated), and the T431s lacks a DVD reader/writer, but I won’t miss that to much. On the other hand I find the fingerprint reader (not faster than typing, but less awkward when typing in front of other people) and the memory card reader (can transfer pictures from a camera fast and without having to search for the right cable) quite useful.</p>
<p>I like the backlit keyboard better than the light on the previous models. I’m less happy about the random placement of the Home/End/PgUp/PgDn keys, which I use a lot. I wouldn’t mind if I could at least map Fn+Up to PgUp, Fn+Left to Home etc, but this does not appear to be possible (tried with KeyTweak). I also use the F keys a lot; these are now by default used to control volume, brightness etc. There is a FnLk, but that has to be reset after waking up from standby.</p>
<p>One of the nice things with Thinkpads is the ability to create custom configurations. I no longer care much about CPUs (Intel Core i7-3687U, 4M Cache, 2.00 GHz), but chose twice the RAM (8G RAM) that I had in the T410s. The disk is a 180GB SSD (would have chosen 250GB, if that had been an option). Had to spend some time removing unwanted trial applications (anti-virus, office), and the large recovery partition and local drivers (after creating a recovery USB drive).</p>
<p>The T431s appears to be much more quiet than the T410s. The T410s had some weird screeching sounds (a known problem with some chipset used in that machine), and was prone to overheating, especially when using the “discrete” ATI graphics card. The “switchable graphics” setup is no longer an option, but the integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 is now powerful enough for me.</p>
<p>The large, smooth trackpad on the T431s is much more pleasant to use than the rough trackpad on the T410s with its poorly defined borders. The trackpad does rattle and feel a bit cheap when depressing it, but I prefer to click by tapping lightly anyway. Should just glue it in place :-)</p>
<p>The DisplayPort is gone, replaced with a (much more common) Mini-DisplayPort. There’s still a VGA port, too. All ports are now on the sides. The T431s still works with the Mini Dock Series 3, using a small (included) piece of plastic to help guide the laptop into position.</p>
<p>The power adapter has been shrunk a bit, which is nice. The power plug was changed as well: It’s no longer round, but looks like (and could be confused with) a USB plug.</p>
<p>The battery life isn’t very impressive, but I seem to get at least 3 hours when using wifi and a reasonable screen brightness. Also, the contrast and brightness of the screen are rather poor. This would be an issue, if I didn’t have the laptop connected to an external monitor most of the time.</p>
<p>Like with previous Thinkpads, the build quality looks good. There is a new hinge design; I’m curious to see how fast the hinges wear out. The hinges on the T410s were a weak spot, wearing out after only a year or so (compared to the hinges on the T42p, which didn’t show any signs of wear even after several years).</p>
<p>All in all, the T431s has been a worthwhile upgrade for me. I’ll keep this post updated…</p>

<p>The red tracks were recorded while driving (or, in one instance, while on a ferry). The yellow tracks were recorded while hiking (or in small boats). I only started recording driving tracklogs end of April, hence the few disconnected hiking tracks on the map.</p>
<p>The map was created with <a href="http://tables.googlelabs.com/">Google Fusion Tables</a>, which somehow is smart enough to be able to show a large number of tracklogs all at once. I wrote a small <a href="build.g">script</a> (in Groovy) to convert a directory containing GPX tracklog files into a single KML file that can be imported into Google Fusion Tables.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Trip report for a one-week vacation on Kauai (Hawaii), April 8th–15th.</p>
<h3 id="Day-1"><a href="#Day-1" class="headerlink" title="Day 1"></a>Day 1</h3><p>Arrived in Lihue in the evening. Picked up our rental car from Hertz (1 min shuttle drive from the terminal). Upgraded the car to a Subaru Forester (AWD) due to some concern about the condition of a road we intended to drive the next day. Checked in at our hotel, the <a href="http://www.astonhotels.com/aston/propertyOverview.do?propertyGroupId=45463">Aston Islander on the Beach</a> in Kapaa [<a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60616-d87217-r61767061-Aston_Islander_on_the_Beach-Kapaa_Kauai_Hawaii.html">My Review</a>].</p>
<h3 id="Day-2"><a href="#Day-2" class="headerlink" title="Day 2"></a>Day 2</h3><p>Got our <a href="http://www.hawaiistateparks.org/parks/kauai/">state park camping permits</a> in Lihue. Spent almost an hour waiting for the paperwork to be completed, but was glad we had been able to get all the permits we wanted on short notice (advance reservations of up to one year are sometimes required). Bought groceries for camping and to stock up our hotel fridge. Didn’t manage to get hold of a gas canister for our camping stove, so we’d have to make do with a Sterno. Bought topo maps at the museum shop. Rented snorkeling gear at <a href="http://www.snorkelbob.com/">Snorkel Bob’s</a>.</p>
<p>Drove around to the west side of the island. To get to Polihale Beach we had to drive the last few miles on a notorious dirt road. There had been a lot of rain prior to our arrival, and we had been warned when we got the permit that we’d get stuck for sure. But the road was starting to dry out, and we made it just fine (albeit covered with mud). Might even have made it with a compact car, but navigating the miles of potholes would have taken forever, and we’d have had to leave the car at the day use area at the end of the road. Found a beautiful spot to set up camp and walked up along the beach until we hit the end.</p>

<h3 id="Day-3"><a href="#Day-3" class="headerlink" title="Day 3"></a>Day 3</h3><p>Drove back to Waimea and from there up to Koke’e State Park along the spectacular Waimea canyon. Stopped at the <a href="http://www.kokee.org/">Koke’e Museum</a> to ask about trail conditions. Started hiking from the end of the road at the Pu’uokila Lookout (amazing views down into Kalalau Valley and out into the ocean). Followed the (muddy) Pihea trail along the valley rim and then down into the Alakai Swamp (nice boardwalk). Followed the Alakai Trail from the intersection to its beginning at a picnic area with stunning views down Waimea Canyon. Headed back, with a small detour up Pihea Peak. Stayed at the Koke’e campground (near the museum).</p>

<h3 id="Day-4"><a href="#Day-4" class="headerlink" title="Day 4"></a>Day 4</h3><p>Drove down to Po’ipu. Po’ipu Beach looked a bit crowded, but we didn’t have trouble finding parking. The snorkeling turned out to be quite simple: Just had to stick the head underwater and watch all kinds of colorful fish swim up. Next we went on a (guided) tour of the Allerton Garden. They had some pretty amazing flowers and fruits growing there. Too bad the guide was more focused on keeping the group entertained with football jokes than lecturing… Before we headed back to the hotel to clean our gear and get a good night’s sleep, we were glad we checked out the “Spouting Horn” blowhole across the road from the garden [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJfSqJ2s7hc">Movie</a>].</p>

<h3 id="Day-5"><a href="#Day-5" class="headerlink" title="Day 5"></a>Day 5</h3><p>Got up early and drove to the other end of the road, Ke’e beach, from where we hiked the Kalalau trail along the Napali coast 11 miles to Kalalau Beach. The trail is notorious for some scary bits along cliffs, but, being used to hiking in the mountains, we did just fine. On the other hand we lost a lot of time slipping along muddy sections of the trail (the first 2 miles were worst). Not to mention time lost crossing several streams (though none more than knee-deep) and filtering water. We also went through several cycles of getting rained on and drying out again, never bothered getting out our rain jackets. Reached Kalalau Valley as the sun was setting. The evening light combined with a rainbow or two made for a very scenic setting. By the time we reached the campground at the other end of the valley, it was dark. Surprised to find the campground packed; took us a while to find an even spot between the tents. </p>

<h3 id="Day-6"><a href="#Day-6" class="headerlink" title="Day 6"></a>Day 6</h3><p>Wished we had a day to explore the valley and talk to the friendly “locals”, but we had to head back out…</p>

<h3 id="Day-7"><a href="#Day-7" class="headerlink" title="Day 7"></a>Day 7</h3><p>Long list of things to do on our last day: Find sea turtles (got lucky in the area next to Brennecker’s Beach, there was even a rare monk seal there). Visit the Museum in Lihue (no stunning exhibits, but interesting nevertheless). Return rented snorkeling gear. Clean our gear (and rental car). Return the snorkeling equipment. Buy gifts. Mail postcards. Print boarding passes. Even managed to swing by the Opaeka’a (yawn) and Wailua (wow) Falls [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpTl_Ohjafc">Movie</a>].</p>
<h3 id="Day-8"><a href="#Day-8" class="headerlink" title="Day 8"></a>Day 8</h3><p>Our flight left early in the morning. On our last day a cold front had hit Hawaii; and since the weather back home in Seattle was nice, there was almost no noticeable difference when we got off the plane!</p>

    <title>Sharing Tracklogs</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While hiking, I often carry along a <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/etrexH/">small GPS device</a> to record my tracks. This is not just useful in case I get lost and need to backtrack, but also allows me to <a href="http://www.robogeo.com/">geotag</a> my pictures before <a href="https://plus.google.com/collection/ctuBZ">uploading</a> them. Plus it can be fun to review a hike in Google Earth. What about sharing tracklogs? This can be valuable when hiking in areas with outdated maps or maps hat don’t have all trails. So I had a look at some of the existing websites for sharing GPS tracklogs–here’s what I found.</p>

<h3 id="TrailRegistry"><a href="#TrailRegistry" class="headerlink" title="TrailRegistry"></a><a href="http://trailregistry.com/">TrailRegistry</a></h3><p>TrailRegistry appears to be one of the oldest sites for sharing tracklogs. It also has the smartest approach, using a <a href="http://www.topofusion.com/network.php">network algorithm</a> to consolidate overlapping tracklogs and remove noise. Unfortunately the site doesn’t appear to have had much effort invested into it since it was set up in 2003.</p>
<h3 id="GPXchange"><a href="#GPXchange" class="headerlink" title="GPXchange"></a><a href="http://www.gpxchange.com/">GPXchange</a></h3><p>GPXchange also appears to have been around since about 2003. The interface is similarly lacking and trail coverage isn’t great. No attempt is made to consolidate tracklogs.</p>
<h3 id="GpsXChange-com"><a href="#GpsXChange-com" class="headerlink" title="GpsXChange.com"></a><a href="http://www.gpsxchange.com/">GpsXChange.com</a></h3><p>GpsXChange.com is a simple forum where people can post tracklogs. Seems to have been around since circa 2006 – like the following sites. Finding a tracklog requires searching the forums e.g. with a trail name. There doesn’t appear to be a huge amount of participation.</p>
<h3 id="Redtrails"><a href="#Redtrails" class="headerlink" title="Redtrails"></a><a href="http://redtrails.com/">Redtrails</a></h3><p>Redtrails is based on the trail maps compiled by <a href="http://switchbacks.com/maps/NW_Trails.html">Northwest Trails</a>, where you can submit tracklogs (and wait for them to be integrated into a consolidated trail map database which is released every month or so). This is by far the most comprehensive set of trails (for Washington State) that I came across.</p>
<h3 id="EveryTrail"><a href="#EveryTrail" class="headerlink" title="EveryTrail"></a><a href="http://www.everytrail.com/">EveryTrail</a></h3><p>EveryTrail is a Web 2.0-ish site where you can share a trip by uploading a tracklog and some pictures. Nice site to browse around, but if you are looking for a specific trail, your chances aren’t to good (unless it happens to be a major tourist attraction). Requires login to download raw tracklogs.</p>
<h3 id="Wikiloc"><a href="#Wikiloc" class="headerlink" title="Wikiloc"></a><a href="http://www.wikiloc.com/">Wikiloc</a></h3><p>Similar to EveryTrail. The interface is a bit less cluttered interface but I found only a dozen hiking trails for all of Washington State. Also requires login to download raw tracklogs.</p>
<h3 id="Garmin-Connect"><a href="#Garmin-Connect" class="headerlink" title="Garmin Connect"></a><a href="http://connect.garmin.com/">Garmin Connect</a></h3><p>The focus of this site seems to be more on keeping track of your fitness than providing hiking trail maps (e.g. it will show additional information such as the heart rate, if recorded), but it has the best interface for looking at tracklogs. There’s a reasonable amount of trails. Exports raw tracklogs in Garmin’s TCX rather than in the standard GPX format.</p>
<h3 id="Trails-com"><a href="#Trails-com" class="headerlink" title="Trails.com"></a><a href="http://www.trails.com/">Trails.com</a></h3><p>This site has been around since at least 2000, but they just started experimenting with letting people upload tracklogs. Tracklogs are attached to trail descriptions taken from books. But I couldn’t get this feature to work yet…</p>
<h3 id="In-conclusion"><a href="#In-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="(In)conclusion"></a>(In)conclusion</h3><p>There is no shortage of options for uploading tracklogs. The ideal site would both store individual tracklogs and aggregate them into consensus trails – while making use of contextual information (How long ago was a tracklog recorded? During what season? Using what device? How reliable is the submitter?). Such as site does not appear to exist at the moment.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I’d bother submitting my (sometimes messy) tracklogs to sites such as TrailRegistry or Northwest Trails. But I do want to make sure that the raw data is available to anyone who wants to crawl it. Hosting the raw files on this blog is an option, but that makes finding the files difficult for anyone but Google. So I’ll probably go with Garmin Connect or Gp(s)XChange.com…</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are my take-away notes from the first day of the <a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/04/gtac-2008-in-seattle.html">Google Testing and Automation Conference</a>.</p>
<p><strong>James A. Whitaker (Microsoft) on <em>The Future of Testing</em>:</strong> Crowdsourcing testing (see e.g. <a href="http://www.utest.com/">uTest</a>) is the simplest way to get an application tested on a large number of different platforms. Such services should also allow testers to focus more on designing rather than executing (manual) tests. Virtualisation could address the issue of hard to reproduce bugs by capturing the state of the machine as part of bug reports. Game testers use maps to highlight areas in game worlds that have been thoroughly tested. Similar visualizations could help people testing normal software what areas of the application need more testing.</p>
<p><strong>Elfriede Dustin and Marcus Borch (IDT) on <em>Advances in Automated Software Testing Technologies</em></strong>: There are <a href="http://generatedata.com/">tools that can help generate random test data</a>. The speakers spoke in great length about generating test code from customer supplied spreadsheets. Not sure if anyone in the audience understood what the advantage of this approach is – I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Andres Almiray (Oracle) on <em>Boosting Your Testing Productivity with Groovy</em>:</strong> This was more about the advantages of Groovy in general than testing, though towards the end of the talk the speaker did show how to create mock objects (using MockFor/StubFor) and how to use DbUnit in Groovy (more or less the same way you’d use it in Java). Oh boy this guy really did drink the Kool-Aid…</p>
<p><strong>Markus Clermont and John Thomas on <em>Taming the Beast: How to Test an AJAX Application</em>:</strong> The speakers did their best to keep he audience awake in this after-lunch talk. This got a bit tiring after the tenth “raise your hand if…”, but they had an excellent point: The amount of large, end-to-end tests (written e.g. with Selenium) should be minimized in favor of “medium”-sized tests that test interactions between specific components (one level deep).</p>
<p><strong>Matt Wood (Sanger Institute) on <em>The New Genomics: Software Development at Petabyte Scale</em>:</strong> This was perhaps the most interesting talk, though it didn’t really go into testing at all!</p>
<p><strong>Marc-Elian Bégin (Six2) on <em>Using Cloud Computing to Automate Full-Scale System Tests</em>:</strong> The case was made that Amazon EC2 is of great use for (system-level) testing. The speaker predicts that paravirtualization (e.g. with Xen) will increasingly be replaced with full virtualization (e.g. KVM), even though latter requires special hardware support (built into most newer processors?).</p>
<p><strong>Vishal Chowdhary (Microsoft) on <em>Practicing Testablity in the Real World</em>:</strong> Good explanation of the basics of writing testable code, though perhaps a bit too basic for the audience that was present.</p>
