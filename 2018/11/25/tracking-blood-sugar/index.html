But these tests don’t necessarily capture how much blood sugar “spikes” after meals–something that may be <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005143">a better predictor of disease risk</a>. Blood sugar spikes can be minimized with a suitable diet, but what that diet should consist of <a href="http://thepersonalizeddiet.com/">differs from person to person</a>. Fortunately, measuring your blood sugar responses is now relatively affordable and hassle-free with the latest generation of Continuous Glucose Monitors.</p>
<h2 id="What-I-did"><a href="#What-I-did" class="headerlink" title="What I did"></a>What I did</h2><p>At my last physical exam, I asked for a prescription for a <a href="https://www.freestylelibre.us/">FreeStyle Libre</a>. The setup consists of a reader device (which may <a href="https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/product-and-innovation/freestyle-librelink.html">no longer be necessary</a>), and disposable sensors that last two weeks each. The reader device can also process blood test strips, so I got some of those as well (and some lancets) so I could check the accuracy of the sensors.</p>
<p><img src="hardware.jpg" alt="FreeStyle Libre"></p>
<p>For four weeks I tried to follow a normal life, eating and doing the things I normally do, with a few small variations, and while keeping an eye open for problematic blood sugar responses (i.e. outside of the 70-140mg/dL range).</p>
<p>I scanned the sensor with the reader before breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, as well as just before going to bed and right after getting up (as the sensor starts overwriting data after just 8 hours). Also in between, sometimes, out of curiosity.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://www.freestylelibre.us/support/overview.html">desktop</a> and <a href="https://www.libreview.com/">web</a> apps generate nice reports for physicians and can export your data as a spreadsheet, but transfering data from the reader with <a href="https://tidepool.org/">Tidepool</a> was less flaky, plus their mobile app let me describe meals better (i.e. not just mark meal times).</p>
<p>Tidepool does a good job visualizing the data, but I wanted to have each day ligned up, and include per-hour step counts from my Fitbit to get an idea of activity levels and sleep times. So I <a href="https://support.tidepool.org/article/37-export-your-account-data">exported my data from Tidepool</a> and created this chart with <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">Altair</a> in a Jupyter Notebook:</p>
<p><img src="timeline.png" alt="timeline chart"></p>
<p>To compare blood sugar responses for specific meals, I extracted and overlaid data into charts like this one, comparing the blood sugar responses for several breakfasts:</p>
<p><img src="breakfast.png" alt="breakfast chart"></p>
<p>For reference, I also kept a record of all my activities with the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/timeline">Google Maps Timeline</a>, including photos of <del>all</del> most of my meals.</p>
<h2 id="What-I-learned"><a href="#What-I-learned" class="headerlink" title="What I learned"></a>What I learned</h2><p>The sensors worked as advertised, and didn’t cause any pain or skin issues, or come off prematurely. The local swimming pool was closed for the duration of the experiment, but I do shower at least once a day. If I were spending more time in the water, or with skin exposed to the sun, or doing rougher activities, I’d consider covering the sensor with something like SIMPATCH tape.</p>
<p>The sensors appeared to be reasonably accurate: The extrapolated glucose levels shown when scanning the sensor were often way off, but the “historic” values that are logged with a lag every 15 minutes or so seemed plausible, and matched the few finger prick tests I did, at least when blood sugar levels were stable.</p>
<p>I had planned to do a few more finger prick tests, but getting enough blood to do a measurement for comparison turned out to be surprisingly difficult. Should have gotten a wider lancet (i.e. 23g instead of 30g), but pharmacies don’t seem to stock those…</p>
<ul>
<li>chocolate and pastries and ice cream YES</li>
<li>regular pasta NO</li>
<li>smoothie bowl &gt; smoothie</li>
<li>insufficient sleep NO</li>
<li>light activity like walking after meals YES</li>
<li>stress NO</li>
<li>overeating NO</li>
</ul>
<p>Blood sugar stays stable while hiking regardless of what I eat. But there is no immediate effect that improves glucose tolerance for snacks or dinner after hiking (though presumably regular exercise improves glucose tolerance).</p>
<p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> This was the least problematic meal. Oatmeal causes a stronger glycemic response than granola, or even French toast smothered in apple sauce or maple syrup. Granola with less cane sugar is better, and <a href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/old-country-style-muesli.html">muesli</a> with no aded sugar is best.</p>
<p>Adding whey protein to my breakfast does/doesn’t make a difference (TBD)?</p>
<p>Skipping my 7-minute exercise session before breakfast once doesn’t make a difference (though it’s possible it might make a long-term difference if I skipped it every day).</p>
<p>Replacing full-fat with low-fat yoghurt in my breakfast smoothie doesn’t make an obvious difference.</p>
<p><strong>Lunch:</strong> places to avoid?</p>
<p><strong>Mid-afternoon snacking:</strong> Chocolate, nuts, ice cream, apples are all unproblematic, as are cookies and cakes, in moderation. Not so good: Mochi.</p>
<p><strong>Dinner:</strong> More problematic than lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Post-workout snack:</strong> Milkshakes: Not a problem after an intense, half hour workout in the evening. But not so good if taken without exercising. No difference if taken immediately after exercising while still at the gym, or a bit later when back home.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>walking reduces blood sugar spikes. due to slower digestion, or due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5610683/">better processing</a>? Apple juice experiment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>lack of sleep makes the blood sugar response less effective (higher peak, longer tail)</p>
</li>
<li>also, eating outside of schedule!</li>
<li><p>dehydration</p>
</li>
<li><p>exercise vs walking vs standing vs sitting vs slouching</p>
</li>
<li><p>cortisol and melatonin down-regulate insulin production</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be presenting more detailed results at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Quantified-Self-Seattle/">the next Seattle Quantified Self meetup</a>.</p>
<h2 id="What-next"><a href="#What-next" class="headerlink" title="What next"></a>What next</h2><p>I intend to do another round of blood sugar tracking in a year or so, or earlier, if my daily routine changes significantly.</p>
<p>Some questions I hope to answer in the future are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do high/low blood sugar levels at night affect sleep quality?</li>
<li>Does fluid intake (incl herbal tea) affect blood sugar levels?</li>
<li>Does chewing gum (Xylitol) affect blood sugar levels?</li>
<li>How much do blood sugar levels drop during an overnight camping trip?</li>
<li>Does the meal duration (and sequencing of items) affect blood sugar levels?</li>
<li>How does fasting (skipping one or more meals) affect blood sugar levels?</li>
</ul>
