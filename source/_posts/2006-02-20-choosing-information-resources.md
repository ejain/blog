According to [this paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.20024) the most influential criteria engineers and scientists use for selecting information resources are not quality or even familiarity but **1.** the time it takes to track down information and **2.** the authoritativeness of the resource. Perhaps this explains why researchers are increasingly using [Google Scholar rather than PubMed](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/331/7531/1487) (PubMed is more authoritative, but Google's ranked results allow you to find publications faster) and why the NCBI still receives more requests for protein-related data than [we](http://uniprot.org/) do (both sites are equally bad at searching, but NCBI may be seen as more authoritative).
