![2010-2019](2010-2019.png)

This map shows every tracklog I recorded while driving and hiking around the Pacific Northwest over the past ten years. The blue tracks were recorded while driving, and the orange tracks while hiking, paddling, or skiing.

## How?

Currently, I use a [Garmin Oregon 450](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/63349) to record most of the outdoor activities, and [Automatic](https://automatic.com/) for driving. Using a phone for tracking is still too much of a trade-off between draining the battery and accuracy for me, especially for longer activities.

Automatic exports spreadsheets, from which [GPX files can be extracted](https://gist.github.com/ejain/14f36c114144b8001e5bfd725ee8681d). Together with the GPX files copied off the Garmin device, these files can be [converted to GeoJSON](https://gist.github.com/ejain/c775d156e79cac872226f68d6cf16d53), which can be imported into and visualized in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/).
