Here's a map that shows every tracklog I recorded this year, driving and hiking around Washington State (mostly).

[![Eric's Tracklogs 2010](//farm6.static.flickr.com/5121/5256169282_e8d8d29480_z.jpg)](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=115713)

The red tracks were recorded while driving (or, in one instance, while on a ferry). The yellow tracks were recorded while hiking (or in small boats). I only started recording driving tracklogs end of April, hence the few disconnected hiking tracks on the map.

The map was created with [Google Fusion Tables](http://tables.googlelabs.com/), which somehow is smart enough to be able to show a large number of tracklogs all at once. I wrote a small [script](build.g) (in Groovy) to convert a directory containing GPX tracklog files into a single KML file that can be imported into Google Fusion Tables.
