This blog started out on [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) sometime during the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble). Somewhere along the way I moved it to a proper hosting provider (first [guest-hosting.ch](guest-hosting.ch), then [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/en-us)), acquired a [.name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.name) domain, and set up a custom [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) installation.

This setup was flexible, but meant I had to stay on top of security updates for WordPress (until automatic updates were introduced), remember to update the packages installed on the server (Ubuntu) once in a while, and deal with occasional comment spam. Also, page load times weren't great (even with various caching plugins), since the site was being served from a low-end virtual server, which nevertheless cost me about $10 a month.

This made going back to serving simple, static files an attractive option. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) was an obvious choice for hosting the site, since I already had several projects on GitHub. I'd also need a _static site generator_ to create the web pages from the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files I exported from WordPress:
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) would have been the default choice, since GitHub Pages has built-in support for Jekyll. But I wanted to be able to build the site on my own machine as well, and that turned out to be painful to set up, and very slow.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) appeared to have most of the same features, and was much faster.
- [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) seemed fast enough, and easier for me to customize than Hugo.

I ended up creating a custom theme for Hexo based on [this theme](https://github.com/klugjo/hexo-theme-clean-blog).

Since switching to serving static pages, I no longer need to worry about security updates. Pages are served fast ([UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) reports response times of well under 100ms). I do miss having a bit more control (like being able to change the cache headers), but so far so good...

You can see the source code for this site [here](https://github.com/ejain/blog/) (the source itself is in the `main` branch, and the generated pages in the `gh-pages` branch).
