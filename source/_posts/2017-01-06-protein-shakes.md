Here's the recipe for my favorite post-exercise recovery drink:

![](ingredients.jpg)

1. 1 cup milk (or random [non-dairy beverage](http://www.pacificfoods.com/food/non-dairy-beverages.aspx))
2. 3 scoops [whey protein](https://www.raworganicwhey.com/)
3. 1 tsp [cacao powder](https://healthworks.com/products/healthworks-raw-certified-organic-cacao-powder-1-lb)
4. 1 tsp [peanut butter](http://cbsnuts.com/wp/product/16oz-jar-cbs-peanut-butter-usa-grown/)
5. 1 [banana](http://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazon-gives-5000-bananas-day-seattle/)

[Blending](https://www.nutribulletpro.com/) this for half a minute results in a smooth, tasty shake. Goes well with dates or figs.
