It&#8217;s not uncommon for organizations to have strict policies regarding the use of [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)ed code, due to the somewhat [viral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft#Is_copyleft_.22viral.22.3F) nature of this license.

Nevertheless I was a bit taken aback when I discovered this sign at the entrance to our garage:

![GPL Prohibited?](/2007/09/07/no-gpl/gpl.jpg)

Moreover, the prohibition sign to the right contains a figure that resembles a hacker wearing a hat!

Microsoft-sponsored conspiracy, or misunderstanding?

**Hint:** I&#8217;m currently working in a [French-speaking](http://www.google.com/search?q=define:GPL&defl=fr) region.
