There is a rather useful (but perhaps somewhat hidden) plug-in for [Protege](http://protege.stanford.edu/) that can be used to compare two versions of an OWL file: [PROMPT](http://protege.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Prompt).

<!--more-->

The plug-in is installed by default in Protege, but needs to be enabled via Project > Configure > Tab Widgets > PromptTab.

Here&#8217;s a screenshot showing differences in the [UniProt &#8220;core&#8221; ontology](http://dev.isb-sib.ch/projects/uniprot-rdf/owl/) from release [10.5](http://beta.uniprot.org/news/2007/05/15/release) to [11.0](http://beta.uniprot.org/news/2007/05/29/release).
