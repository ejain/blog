Gave a brief talk about programmatic access to [beta.uniprot.org](http://beta.uniprot.org/) at the [EMBRACE workshop](http://www.ch.embnet.org/EMBRACE/) in Geneva today.

Here are the slides that I showed along with the demo I gave:



The workshop (which was really more of a series of normal talks than a real workshop) ended with a SOAP vs [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) debate. The SOAP camp felt that their technology would in some unspecified way address interoperability issues. The REST camp on the other hand had plenty of war stories that showed that SOAP helped little with that but introduced a lot of problems. Of course no consensus was reached, but some of the participants volunteered to write a review paper that explains the different positions... Let's see what comes out of that.
