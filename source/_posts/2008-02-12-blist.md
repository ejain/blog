[Blist](http://www.blist.com/) is an interesting cross between a spreadsheet application and an interface to a proper database. The goal (I believe) is to allow mere mortals to create and share simple databases on the Web.

<!--more-->

Upon logging in and creating a &#8220;blist&#8221;, you are presented with a spreadsheet-like view. You then drag and drop data types onto the spreadsheet to create columns.

![Screenshot](/2008/02/12/blist/screenshot.png)

&#8220;Lenses&#8221; can be created to get non-tabular (and filtered) views of your data. Data can be entered directly both in the table or in the &#8220;lense&#8221; views. There are options to share and discuss &#8220;blists&#8221; &#8212; however these don&#8217;t seem to be implemented yet.

Blist is still in a very early stage. Following are some comments, based on my initial impression.

### Neat!

In addition to the standard data types (text, numbers, dates etc) there are lots of unusual but useful data types such as email addresses, images, and star ratings.

Columns (unlike in a normal spreadsheet) can be set to allow multiple values in a single &#8220;cell&#8221; (possible, but cumbersome to implement with a normal database).

You can easily create &#8220;custom types&#8221; a.k.a. &#8220;pick lists&#8221; or enumerations.

It is possible to group/nest columns one level deep, creating a &#8220;blist-in-a-blist&#8221;.

Blist (unlike a normal database) doesn&#8217;t prevent invalid values in fields that expect a certain format. But (unlike a normal spreadsheet) invalid values are highlighted.

### Suggestions&#8230;

If non-technical users are the main audience, it may be worth thinking about making the interface less intimidating. Too many buttons and controls!

Features that haven&#8217;t been implemented yet would probably better be hidden from view. It&#8217;s frustrating to not know if a button is disabled because you&#8217;re in the wrong mode, or because it isn&#8217;t implemented yet&#8230;

Support for undoing actions (and fewer prompts).

Support for changing the data type of a column (e.g. from number to string).

There is a nice calendar control for entering dates. Unfortunately it can&#8217;t be bypassed &#8212; if you want to enter an old date you need to go back in time month by month&#8230; The money data type is nice, too, but seems to be USD only.

Some of the data types muddle the distinction between data type and display. For example, is a checkbox really a different data type than a boolean &#8212; or is it just another way to display boolean values?

Help, Firefox eats all my memory! (May be an issue with Flash?)

I bet a geo-location data type and map view is already being worked on&#8230;

If the query builder showed a preview of the results, this would save some tedious back and forth when building queries. Speaking of search: Where is the quick search?

Should be able to link blists to each other (one of the killer features of relational databases)!

Support copy-pasting single (and multiple) cells.

Finally, there is a typo in the &#8220;downloading Lenss&#8221; status message :-)

### Conclusion

While Blist isn&#8217;t the first effort to do spreadsheets or databases on the Web (think [Google Spreadsheet](http://docs.google.com/) or [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/)), the way it combines the best features from both worlds seems new (to me, at least).

Will be interesting to see how the &#8220;social&#8221; features are implemented &#8212; and of course if their infrastructure manages to scale (especially once they enable the data import feature and people start dumping existing collections into Blist)!

  <p>
    Some more suggestions regarding the <a href="http://blog.blist.com/index.php/2008/02/20/new-features-excel-import-sharing-charts-search/">features added in the latest release</a>:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Import: Support tab-delimited files in addition to CSV? Auto-detect e.g. numeric columns? Support creating custom types during import? Need to know a bit more than &#8220;There was a problem uploading your file&#8221; if something goes wrong!
    </li>
    <li>
      Charts: This will be useful once aggregates are supported! Can the generated charts be copy-pasted into e.g. PowerPoint?
    </li>
    <li>
      Search: Don&#8217;t need substring matches &#8212; but more speed! Highlight matches? Support for multiple search terms? Searches across several blists?
    </li>
    <li>
      Sharing: Will there be a way to make blists public, and link to them?
    </li>
  </ul>
