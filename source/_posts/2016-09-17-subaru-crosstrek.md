With my 2008 Honda Civic approaching 100K miles, I decided it was time to replace it. The Civic had been very reliable, and put up with a lot of abuse from driving on bumpy dirt roads without any problems--apart from one broken motor mount. But I didn't want to push my luck. Also, the upcoming winter is forecast to have proper snow again...

Requirements:
- Good ground clearance and suspension, so I don't have to crawl around every pothole, and be afraid of scraping the bottom of the car.
- Similar width and length as the old car, so I can park the car around town without causing too much damage.
- Adaptive cruise control, so I can use cruise control even when the road isn't empty (and feel like the new car is more sophisticated than the old car).
- Silver color, so dirt and scratches aren't quite as visble.
- Decent gas mileage (at least 30mpg).
- Cost <$30K.

Cars I considered:
- Honda HRV
- Mazda CX-5
- Subaru Crosstrek

The HRV would have been an obvious choice, given my good experience with the Civic and the [Honda of Seattle](http://www.hondaofseattle.com/) service department. Unfortunately, the HRV doesn't have an option for adaptive cruise control (need to get the larger CRV for that), and the ground clearance isn't great. The CX-5 and the Crosstrek have similar ground clearance, features, safety ratings etc. The CX-5 has an option for a more powerful engine, but feels more like an SUV than a compact car, so I decided to check out the Crosstrek first.

I test-drove a Crosstrek two weeks ago at [Chaplin Subaru](http://www.chaplinssubaru.com/), and loved it, but no one had the configuration I was looking for. [Roy Robinson Subaru](http://www.royrobinson.com/) was one of 3 dealers in the region to receive a matching Crosstrek today (and one of the easiest to deal with), so that's who got my business!

Things I learned:
- Some dealers are still having a hard time with the internet. Had to restate my original request up to three times before getting an answer from some of them.
- If you are buying a popular model, finding a dealer who has a vehicle available can be tricky.
- Even so, every dealer (with the exception of Carter Subaru in Seattle) was willing the match prices, and sell at $1K "below invoice", which happened to correspond to the price I got from [TrueCar](https://www.truecar.com/).
- Local sales taxes differ slightly from dealer to dealer; this can add up to a few hundred $.
- Dealers load up cars with optional features you might not need; doing a factory order could have saved me almost $1K.
- ...however, negotiating a [good trade-in value](https://www.kbb.com/used-cars/) for the old car would have been difficult with a factory order (which takes at least 6 weeks to deliver).
- Doing a trade-in has significant tax advantages.
