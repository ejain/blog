A fancy-looking desert that is quick and simple to prepare... Serves 4.

![](panna-cotta.jpg)

- 1 cup whole milk
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 tbsp sugar 
- 2 tsp agar agar powder
- 1 tsp vanilla

Combine ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Let cool for a few minutes before pouring into forms. Refrigerate.

For the raspberry coulis topping:

- 1 cup frozen raspberries
- Â¼ cup sugar

Disolve the sugar in 1 tbsp of hot water. Combine with raspberries and blend briefly (long enough to crush the raspberries, but not long enough to pulverize the seeds). Strain through a narrow sieve. Layer on top of the panna cotta before serving.
