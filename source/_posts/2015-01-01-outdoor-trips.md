Looking back at all the outdoor trips we did last year, [the stats](https://zenobase.com/#/buckets/u07qih0a27/?q=timestamp:2014) look almost identical to the previous year's. Couple more overnight trips (10), thanks to the great weather. All in all, we hiked and paddled about 470 mi with 110,000 ft elevation gain on 59 trips.
