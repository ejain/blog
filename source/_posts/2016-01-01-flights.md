Collected tracks for every flight I took last year from [FlightAware](https://flightaware.com/), and used [this script](https://gist.github.com/ejain/ea143f446bb568ec20d6) to merge the tracks into a single file that could be imported into [Google Fusion Tables](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/). This is the result:
