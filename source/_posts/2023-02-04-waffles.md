![Presto Belgian Waffle Maker](waffle-iron.jpg)

After staying at an Airbnb that came equipped with a waffle maker, we decided to get one at home. Ended up getting a [Presto FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker](https://www.gopresto.com/product/presto-flipside-belgian-waffle-maker-03510), mainly because it doesn't take up much space when stored away, but it also works well. 

Settled on this fool-proof recipe, after some trial-and-error:

1. Combine 220 g flour + 50 g starch + 1 tsp salt in a large bowl
2. Melt 75 g butter
3. Warm up 150 ml water + 150 ml milk
4. Combine 60 g sugar + 11 g baking powder
5. Stir 4 eggs into the center of the flour
6. Stir molten butter into the flour, slowly
7. Stir warmed milk into the flour, slowly
8. Add 1 lid rum + 1 tsp vanilla
9. Stir in 20 m oil
10. Stir in sugar for 2 minutes, or until folly dissolved
11. Rest 15 minutes
