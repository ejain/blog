In the latest effort to make myself obsolete by the end of this year, [we](http://expasy.org/people/swissprot.html) are looking for a software developer to help us better make our data available to both humans and machines. The main responsibilities of this position will be the further development of the [UniProt web site](http://beta.uniprot.org/) and the [UniProt RDF distribution](http://dev.isb-sib.ch/projects/uniprot-rdf/).

If you have some experience with coding Java, have a strong interest in science and the technologies we use, thrive in ~~chaotic~~ open environments, and would like to work in one of the world's [best cities to live](http://www.mercerhr.com/referencecontent.jhtml?idContent=1128060), here are the [instructions for applying](http://www.isb-sib.ch/infos/careers_070625.htm).

You can meet me at [BOSC](http://open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2007) and [ISMB](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2007/) next month. If you have any questions, [contact me](mailto:Eric.Jain@isb-sib.ch)!
