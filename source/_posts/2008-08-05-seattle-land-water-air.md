Having my sister visit me here in Seattle provided a good excuse to do some local sightseeing--first by land and water with the [Ducks of Seattle](http://www.ridetheducksofseattle.com/), then by air with [Seattle Sea Planes](http://www.seattleseaplanes.com/).

Here are the exact routes taken on these two tours:

The routes were recorded with a Garmin eTrex H, and the maps were created with [Robogeo](http://www.robogeo.com/home/).
