Sous vide cooking isn't just [for main courses](/2019/07/17/sous-vide-cooking/), but can also be used to prepare desslighterts. Here are my favorites.

## Cheese Cake

Based on [a recipe from Cook's Illustrated](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/13699-sous-vide-lemon-cheesecake-cups).

#### Topping

- 3 graham crackers
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1½ tsp sugar
- ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
- pinch of salt

Crumble crackers in the processor. Melt butter, stir in sugar, cinnamon, salt, and crumbs. Continue stirring for a minute or so, then let cool down.

#### Filling

- 4 tbsp sugar
- 1½ tsp grated lemon zest
- 12 oz cream cheese
- 2 eggs
- ¼ cup whipping cream
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

Process sugar and lemon zest, add cream cheese and process. Add eggs, cream, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt, and process. Transfer to containers, and cook for 60-75 minutes at 80°C. Let cool down and refrigerate a couple of hours. Add the crumbs before serving.
