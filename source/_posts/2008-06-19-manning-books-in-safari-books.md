Over the last few days several books from [Manning Publications](http://www.manning.com/) appear to have been added to [Safari Books](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/).

So far there are 11 books, from [Jess in Action](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9781930110892) (published July 2003) to [jQuery in Action](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9781933988351) (published February 2008). I&#8217;m somewhat surprised that there was no announcement (so far) on either company&#8217;s web sites&#8230; In any case I&#8217;m hoping that there is more to come!
