Upgraded my breakfast from cereal with yoghurt to "smoothie bowls" last year. After a lot of experimenting, here's what I've settled on (for now):

1. 1 cup yoghurt
2. 1 tsp spirulina
3. 1 tsp chia seeds
4. 2 tsp golden flaxseed meal
5. 1 cup frozen fruit (mango, pineapple, strawberry, cranberry, blueberry, banana)
6. 1 leaf collard green and lacinato kale

I [blend this](https://www.nutribulletpro.com/) for just under a minute, sprinkle some granola on top, and this is the result:
