I gave a talk at the [Seattle Java User Group](http://www.seajug.org/) this week, where I talk about two technologies I use [at work](http://www.sciscogenetics.com/): The [OSGi](http://www.osgi.org/About/Technology) module system, and the [Eclipse Rich Client Platform](http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform). Giving this talk was a good experience, and the audience was great. You can watch the talk below, or flip through [the slides](https://www.slideshare.net/ejain/osgi-and-eclipse-rcp).
