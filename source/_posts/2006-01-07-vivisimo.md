[Vivisimo](http://vivisimo.com/) has set up a [new site](http://biometacluster.com/) for searching content from life-science-related journals and databases &ndash; though none of ours so far.

One of the interesting features of this search engine is that it attempts to cluster results by topic. This seems to work quite well for medical conditions (e.g. "stroke"), but is less suitable for distinguishing words used in different contexts (e.g. gene names from words). The ranking also needs some work, and a search for "uniprot" results in "Did you mean uniprost"...
