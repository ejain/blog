It looks like our initiative to port all of our code to a [more compact and efficient language](http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/) didn't get very far. So what next?

Perhaps we should try a simpler and more "friendly" programming language: [ToonTalk](http://www.toontalk.com/).

Variables are called [boxes](http://www.toontalk.com/English/box.htm), function calls are [flying birds](http://www.toontalk.com/English/bird.htm) and strings are [text pads](http://www.toontalk.com/English/text.htm).

Instead of a stack there is [Dusty the Vacuum](http://www.toontalk.com/English/dusty.htm), instead of comparator functions you use [scales](http://www.toontalk.com/English/scale.htm), and object creation is done by [construction trucks](http://www.toontalk.com/English/truck.htm).

Best of all: Instead of automatic garbage collection (which everone knows is decadent), you need to [blow up stuff](http://www.toontalk.com/English/bomb.htm) to free memory.
