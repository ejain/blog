	<section id="1">
		<title>Delhi</title>
		
		<note>Seven hour flight from Switzerland to Delhi, arrival around 01:00 
		in the morning. Getting off the plane, going through immigration, 
		changing money, making a reservation at a hotel and pushing through all 
		the helpful people in front of the airport to get a prepaid taxi takes 
		about an hour. The taxi driver neither knows where the hotel is nor does 
		he know any english, but after another hour or so and a stop at a 
		tourist office, who's owner tries to convince me that the hotel I just 
		called is closed, we finally get there.</note>
		
		<image id="rs10">10 Rupees, or three cups of tea.</image>

		<title>Delhi to Jaipur</title>
		
		<note>By the time I get up it's nearly lunchtime. Doesn't matter, 
		since indian breakfast is more like lunch anyways.</note>
		
		<note>After wandering around a bit and organizing a few details I get on 
		a train to Jaipur. Pretty simple; each train is announced many times 
		both in english and in hindu, and the number of the wagon and your seat 
		number is printed on the ticket. Surviving the eight hours in the train 
		is easy too, every few minutes somebody selling coffee or tea passes 
		by.</note>
